# structure_to_function

Constraining multicompartmental, electron microscopy-based neuron models with e-phys data (patch clamp)

Goal is to understand how to predict the functional synaptic strength between two neurons given only electron-microscopic connectomics data (i.e. that is available for the fruit fly brain from the Janelia hemibrain project).
